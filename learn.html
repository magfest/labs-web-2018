Let's fix that, starting now. Please welcome back a man of seemingly infinite voices, Wes Johnson! When he isn't rocking the red with the Washington Capitals as their stadium announcer, he's filling a voice role for Bethesda, Blizzard, or countless other projects. Wes goes by many other names: Sheogorath. Lucien Lachance. The Silver Shroud. Fawkes. Moe Cronin. Herameus Mora. He was both the Criminal Scum and the Guards who arrested them! Wes was EVERY Protectron robot, Mr Burke, and Scribe Bigsley. He was in a John Waters film. The man was in The Wire! It's hard to think of things he HASN'T appeared in.</p>

He is the original designer and programmer of The Incredible Machine! A few of his other games are Skyfox II, F-14 Tomcat, Heart of China, Rise of the Dragon, 3D Ultra Minigolf, Marble Blast, and most recently, Contraption Maker.

                    <p>Test Chambers are the heart and soul of MAGLabs. If you have an idea that you would like to try to make happen, we have the volunteers, space and resources to help bring your idea to life. Our lego room, escape room, VR area, and lock picking have all started as test chambers. The next idea could be yours.</p>
