# MAGLabs 2018 Website

This is the repository for the 2018 MAGLabs website. It's very simple, basic html. 

It can be hosted using anything (apache, nginx, python, node, etc...) - one easy option is python. 

```bash
# Python 2:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000

# Python 3:
python -m http.server 3000
```

This hosts it on port 3000, so you can get to it at: http://localhost:3000
